            <p>hi, my name is abdul majid, i am a developer and web design. <br> This is the first website I created to start my career as a developer. <br> Initially, I created this website to learn how and to what extent I developed my skills in this developer
                field. <br> I said I wanted to be a developer because I wanted to learn about the world of computers and everything. becoming a programmer or developer is not easy, but in this world there is nothing impossible to do, <br> like the blunt
                knife the more we sharpen the knife it will certainly be sharp, as well as being a developer, the more we struggle <br> and work hard to hone our skills and don't give up we can definitely achieve what we want it. dizziness or stress problems,
                yes that's only natural, <br> if you feel dizzy and stressed about the material you are studying means that there is something in you that must be upgraded or you are learning new things in your life. for example if you play a game you
                will definitely be stressed if you can't move forward or get through the round, <br> well, of course you will do something, namely upgrade something right whether it's a weapon or a skill, that's the picture in learning this programming.
                I dare say this because in this world there is nothing that is impossible and cannot be done, just start first. if you fail it <br> means your limits, it's natural and you have to think about how skip your boundaries, we better experience
                failure than afraid to try or even just sit around waiting to be eaten, <br> JUST START FIRST. THANK YOU
